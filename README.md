This is a fast point-cloud renderer in C++ using OpenGL with GLFW, GLEW and GLAD.

There is CSV sample data provided in the SampleData directory which is being loaded by default.

## Interface
- W, S, A, D keys to move around
- R to reset the camera view in case you got lost in space :-)
- mousewheel / touch pad for zoom and view direction
- 1, 2 to increase / decrease point size.
- 3, 4 keys to move forward and backwards through data files
